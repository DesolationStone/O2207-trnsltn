A BIT ABOUT Chris

Since his childhood 
Chris was a very strong
and nimble boy, but he 
always had difficultiess
find a common ground, be
it with children or adults.
If Chris suddenly wants
to eat a delicious candy,
he would likely take it
by force, rather than by
persuasion or deception.

A bit rude, ruthless, not
afraid of anything and
eager for adventure...
Is he really the hero of
this new age we seek?
