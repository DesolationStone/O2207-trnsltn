1:For the first time in its history, Olympus was left without its Administrator. No one was responsible for the coordination of separate departments of the tower.
2:Without a leader, different branches of Olympus started revolting. The skyscraper was plunged into anarchy. Part of its dwellers escaped into the wasteland, a lot of them died in the process. 
3:Eventually, the tower's security systems started to fail, and its lower levels became flooded with inhabitants of Radius. Assessing the situation, DEUS activated the total protection protocol.
4:With all its entrances sealed, the Olympus was instantly turned into a tomb with everyone inside. As time went by, the inhabitants of Radius lost all interest in the impregnable skyscraper.
