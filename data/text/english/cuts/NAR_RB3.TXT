1:The new Rainbow leader released Naomi Young, and she left the settlement at the first opportunity, taking with her only a small bag of food and medical supplies.
2:Without Naomi Young, the production of the Drop, along with other drugs, came to a complete halt. Merchants no longer visited the settlement - there was nothing of value to them in Rainbow.
3:The supply of water and food dropped drastically, and the inhabitants were forced to find another place to live. Many of them never made it to other settlements because of weakness and hunger.
