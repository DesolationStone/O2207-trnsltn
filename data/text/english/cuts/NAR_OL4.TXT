1:The new Administrator of Olympus has ordered the release of all Tartarus' Servants, giving each of them weapons, food rations and medicine. Radius' settlements were supplied with machinery, water filters, fertilizer, and weapons from the skyscraper. 
2:Many of the former Servants died without the necessary survival skills. Some committed suicide, disillusioned with the Gods of Olympus.
3:The military of Olympus did not accept this course of action. They defected from the tower and seized power in Jackals, turning it into the most powerful faction in Radius.
4:Left without means of defense and its army, Olympus was soon pillaged by the New Jackals.
