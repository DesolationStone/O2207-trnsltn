1:The new Administrator of Olympus ordered to set free every Servant of Tartarus, issuing each of them with weapons, food rations, and medicines. The settlements of Radius were supplied with machinery, water filters, fertilizers, and weapons from the skyscraper. 
2:Many of the former Servants died without necessary survival skills. Some of them committed suicide, disillusioned with the Gods of Olympus.
3:The military of Olympus did not agree with the course. They deserted from the tower, and seized power at Jackals, turning it into the most powerful faction in Radius.
4:Left without means of defense and its army, Olympus was soon plundered by the New Jackals.
