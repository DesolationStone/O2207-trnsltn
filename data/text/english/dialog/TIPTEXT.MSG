{10}{}{Welcome to "Olympus 2207"!}
{11}{}{If you are playing Olympus 2207 for the first time, we strongly recommend that you enable hints.}
{12}{}{Do you want to get hints during gameplay?}
{13}{}{}
{14}{}{}
{15}{}{You have completed enough tasks to move on to the next part of the game. To do this, "use" your bed on the first level.}
{16}{}{You have completed all the tasks and can now move on to the next part of the game. To do this, "use" your bed on the first level.}
{17}{}{You have received your first item assembling task. To access the build panel, click on the " HMS " icon on the right side of the interface panel (see figure below) and follow the instructions. To gain access to the collection of other items, your hero must learn about the possibility of assembling them.}
{18}{}{To repair the fuse box, you can apply the "Science" skill to it and fix it manually. Also, you can hack electronic locks, after opening their electric panel with a screwdriver.}
{19}{}{Be careful when trying to steal from someone, because if your theft skill is too low, then there is a 25% chance that the victim will notice your malicious intentions and attack you! Keep in mind that to steal from merchants, your skill must be at least 100-120%}
{20}{}{By killing someone, you not only increase your kill count but also change your karma! Be extremely careful shooting the next person between the eyes, because if he turns out to be a plot character, then you will have to pave the way through a mountain of corpses!}
{21}{}{When solving the tasks you face, remember that each decision you make affects your karma and the attitude of individual characters and entire locations towards you. The level of your karma depends on the options for lines available in dialogues, options for solving quests, and even the availability of quests.}
{22}{}{Fixing a sparking fuse box is a complicated and unsafe task! If your "Repair" skill is high enough, you can try to use it for repairs. If you doubt your repair abilities use the "Science" skill and try your luck with your own hands. Or if you have more of a silver tongue, you can just ask someone else to fix the fuse box for you. For example, Smitty at the technical level.}
{23}{}{You must go down to the "farm" floor and get a list of the day's tasks from the Herald standing in the center of the farms. To move between the floors of Tartarus, "use" the passageways/stairs behind the guards.}
{24}{}{RADIATION! Monitor your body's radiation levels using the "Radiometer" or the accumulated radiation messages in the information display on the left side of the control panel. If you have accumulated more than 300 rad, your Strength and Agility will decrease, and even after cleansing the body of radiation, it will take another couple of days for these stats to recover. If you accumulate more than 400-500 rad, you risk losing health points, and reduced stats might not recover. If you do not want to suffer from radiation - lower the difficulty of the game to "low" right now.}
{25}{}{Anderson is dead. Standing over the body of a defeated enemy, you remember your long and difficult journey from a naive servant to the conqueror of Olympus, who managed to defeat "God". You are the first to reach the end of this path. And even if many questions remain unanswered, from now on this is the fate of others following in your footsteps. And you... What other choice do you have? Did Anderson have one? Olympus NEEDS a head figure. [Take Anderson's place]}
{26}{}{If this is not the first time you have decided to explore the world of "Olympus" - you have the opportunity to skip the initial stages of the game in Tartarus right now. This resolves all skipped quests at the lower end of possible experience points, and all skipped solutions will be considered neutral by default. Do you want to skip the initial stages of Tartarus?}
{27}{}{As the game progresses, you will encounter a large number of different items. The most important and interesting ones are marked with a * in the title. If you find such an item, hold on to it! Most likely it is an important part of a quest or the key to some amazing place in the game world!}
